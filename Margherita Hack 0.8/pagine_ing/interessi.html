                    <h3>VEGETARIANISM</h3>
		<div style="display:inline-block;width:80%;">
                    <p>Margherita has been a vegetarian all her life, but as she herself said, "without any merit and sacrifice."
                        Her parents, even before she was born, had converted to theosophy, an Indian philosophy that advocates
                        respect for all living beings. Margherita talks about the amazement of her classmates and concerns about
                        her diet, yet this never stopped her from playing sports: she participated in school tournaments, won two
                        national university championships in athletics, and her bike rides are famous.</p></div>

                <div class="feature2">
                    <h3>BICYCLE</h3>
                    <p>From a young age, Margherita showed her passion for bicycles: from the enthusiasm for the Giro d'Italia,
                        to the races with champagne corks simulating the Tour de France, to getting her first bike. A bricklayer,
                        later a family friend, taught her to ride a bike using a heavy adult bike since there were no bikes for
                        children. </p>
					<img class="foto2" style="width:20%;" src="../img/ruota.png" style="margin-left:30px;">
					<div style="display:inline-block;width:75%;">
					<p>In the summer of '37, her parents gave her a bike as a gift, and from then on, her tours began
                        in Prato, Pistoia, Empoli, Pratolino (despite the 18-kilometer journey), and anywhere she could go. After
                        abandoning bicycles for years, preferring motor vehicles, in '64, when she arrived in Trieste, she got back
                        on the saddle to pedal to Topolini di Barcola and home after work. Soon, from city rides, she moved on to
                        long Saturday trips on the coast and discovered Carso with her cyclist friends, enjoying the feeling of
                        freedom running with the wind in her face and looking at nature. In the last years of her life,
                        unfortunately, Margherita had to hang up her bike.</p></div>

                    <h3>HER FAIRY TALES</h3>
                    <p>One of the fairy tales that accompanied Margherita in her childhood is undoubtedly the story of Pinocchio,
                        the wooden puppet known for his lies and naivety. Margherita reflects on the analogies between Collodi's
                        story and our society, on how the latter is full of Pinocchios and fraudsters. Another protagonist of
                        Margherita's stories is Ulysses: in his journey back from the Trojan War, he encounters various
                        dangers that keep him away from his return to Ithaca. Ulysses, unlike Pinocchio, is clever, and through his
                        ingenuity and tricks, he manages to escape dangers. She also recalls Peter Pan, the child who didn't want
                        to grow up, Alice in Wonderland with its absurd characters and impossible landscapes, and Pippi Longstocking,
                        a brave and independent girl who became a model in that era when the equality of rights began to assert
                        itself.</p>

                <div class="feature2">
                    <h3>RELIGION</h3>
                    <p>Margherita has always declared herself an atheist. Her family had converted to theosophy, an Indian
                        philosophy that advocated respect for all living beings. As for her beliefs, she always believed in
                        explaining miracles as natural phenomena and supported the existence of other forms of life originating
                        from other planets. She always despised superstitions and defined herself as anticlerical, but despite
                        this, she never took extreme positions on the subject.</p>
					 <div style="display:inline-block;width:80%;"><p>
                     An example of her ideas can be found in the book
                        "I Believe," which gathers conversations between the atheist scientist Margherita Hack and the Catholic
                        priest Don Pierluigi di Piazza. Although they had different views on religion and the existence of God,
                        they found common ethical values such as solidarity, respect for the environment, and social justice.
                        Margherita Hack, despite being atheist, admired the beauty of the universe without excluding the
                        possibility of a transcendent origin. Her scientific perspective limits the discussion about the meaning
                        and significance of the universe but does not deny the existence of things beyond scientific
                        explanation. Her view represents an interesting intersection between a scientific approach and an openness
                        to the wonder of existence.</p></div>

                    <h3>Her Role in Society</h3>
                    <p>She expressed opposition to the opening of nuclear centers in Italy, as she recognized their dangers and
                        responsibilities, but fully supported and deemed nuclear research necessary. Hack always advocated for
                        human rights in Italy and worldwide, supported feminism, publicly supported laws in favor of abortion,
                        euthanasia, and the rights of homosexuals.</p>

                <div class="feature2">
                    <h3>Politics</h3>
                    <p>Margherita has always been dedicated to politics. In her youth, she proclaimed herself a fascist, but in
                        1938, she decided to become anti-fascist and identified with socialist and later communist thinking. She
                        always despised Italian politics and compared some politicians to fairy tale characters like Pinocchio.
                        In fact, in Italy, she was famous for her anti-religious views and her continuous criticisms of the Catholic
                        Church, its hierarchy, and its institutions. In addition to always being interested in politics, she also
                        took part in it: she ran in the Italian regional elections of 2005 in Lombardy on the list of the Italian
                        Communist Party. After the election, she gave up her seat to Bebo Storti. She joined the Italian
                        Communist Party again in the Italian general elections of 2006. She was a candidate for various
                        constituencies of the Chamber of Deputies but decided to give up her seat to dedicate herself to
                        astronomy.</p>
