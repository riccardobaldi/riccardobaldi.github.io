        <h3>LIFE</h3>
		<img class="foto1" src="../img/profilo.png">
		<div style="width:73%;display:inline-block;" >
        <p>She was born on June 9, 1922, in Florence, in the house on Via Caselli, at the corner with Via Cento
                    Stelle near Campo di Marte.
                     Later, she moved with her parents to Via Ximenes (named after a
                     mathematician-astronomer) near the hill of Arcetri, the site of the current astrophysical observatory
                     (and the village of Arcetri where Galileo spent his last years, under "house arrest" in the villa Il Gioiello).<br>
					The elements that make it up are positive, the activities, and negative, the liabilities.
        </p></div>
      </div>


     <div class="feature2">
      <h3>Parents</h3>
      <p>Her father, Roberto Hack, was of Swiss origin, Protestant, worked as an
         accountant and her mother, Catholic, a teacher and graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts, was
         a miniaturist at the Uffizi Gallery.
         Neither of them was satisfied with their religions, so they embraced
	     theosophy: her parents always allowed her the freedom to believe in what
		 she wanted.
		 She never believed in reincarnation.
		 She didn't worry about death, but she did about illness.
		 "I'm afraid of suffering, of not being autonomous anymore, that's why I'm so in favor
		 of euthanasia. Life and death belong to man and not to God, in my opinion."
		 </p>

        <h3>Youth</h3>
        <p>During the fascist period, they suffered heavy discrimination for not joining the
					party.
					She lived most of her youth under the dictatorship of fascism: her
					family was affected by fascist laws because her father, employed at Valdarno
					- the Tuscan electric company - was fired for not joining the fascist party. Her
					mother for many years was the only support of the family selling to tourists the
					miniatures she made at the Uffizi.</p>
      </div>

	  <div class="feature2">
        <h3>Repercussions of Fascism</h3>
        <p>As a girl, she didn't know what fascism was until 1938 (enactment of racial laws): she had an excellent science teacher who was Jewish; from one day to the next
					she no longer came to school. They tried to find out, to know what had happened to her...
					then she realized what fascism really meant.
					Only after the war did they learn that she had been imprisoned in Santa Verdiana,
					the women's prison in Florence, and that twenty days later she had committed suicide: she had
					poisoned herself.</p>
      <div style="width:75%;display:inline-block;" >
       
     
        <p>In May 1940, arguing in class with some fascist comrades, she had
					proclaimed herself against entering the war. She was reported by the principal, labeled as
					"a defeatist" and anti-fascist.
					She risked losing the entire year and being expelled from all schools, but the
					professors' council managed to obtain only a one-month suspension and
					punished with a seven in conduct. She was supposed to go in October with all
					subjects, with that seven in conduct, but Italy's entry into the war
					On June 10, 1940, the abolition of graduation exams and she passed with the vote
					by scrutiny.
					"It's strange to think that I got through thanks to the Second World War."</p></div>

        <h3>Choice of Faculty</h3>
        <p>She enrolled in Letters because it was the only faculty she had heard of, and she had
					a lot of ease in writing, but she only stayed there for an hour: it was boring
					and she realized that she was more cut out for deeds than for chatter, so she decided
					to leave, and only then did she remember that physics was the subject she liked
					the most and enrolled in that faculty.
					She went through the entire university during the war, and graduated with 101, in January 1945,
					instead of October â€˜44 (due to delays due to the war), with a thesis on
					astrophysics related to research on Cepheids, a class of variable stars.</p>

        <h3>Marriage with Aldo</h3>
        <p>In February 1944, she married Aldo: she had no desire to get married,
					she considered marriage useless.
					"In church, then! I was ashamed like a dog." But Aldo's parents were religious.
					It was a very simple ceremony, there were about eight people. No wedding lunch.
					They went alone to eat at a trattoria.</p>
      </div>
        <p>They had known each other since they were children, in Florence: she was eleven and he was thirteen, they
						met and spent time playing together.
						They didn't see each other for 10 years: Aldo's father was transferred for work.
						They met again at university but didn't like each other very much:
						"We always argued, and I don't remember how it ended up that we fell in love and
						even got married, also because we're really different: I'm an atheist.
						He was Catholic, I am a person of science and he a literary, a living encyclopedia,
						I am combative, he too but unpredictable, a dreamer, like an
						extraterrestrial."
						They never had children, she believed that there are those who are meant to be parents,
						and those who are not, and she said she was not inclined and besides, he was never interested
						in becoming a mother.</p>
      </div>

	  <div class="feature2">
        <h3>First Work Experiences</h3>
        <p>Her first real job was offered to her in 1947 by Ducati in Milan, which produced
						photographic machines. She accepted and moved there, but the following year she preferred to return
						to the Florentine university environment, as she was offered the position of assistant
						appointed.
						After the Milanese period, the Arcetri Observatory became almost her second
						home.</p>
      
        <p>In 1950, she won the competition for the position of assistant professor in the astronomy department.
						In 1964, she had her first job in Trieste for the astronomy department at the Institute
						of Theoretical Physics of the University of Trieste. She rebuilt an almost nonexistent Observatory and founded a school, where she was
						director.
						In 1997, she retired and began discovering new hobbies like volleyball, cycling, and swimming.</p>
      </div>

	  <div class="feature2">
        <h3>Ideologies</h3>
        <p> She has always been a vegetarian, as her parents were too.
						"Meat disgusts me, fish even more. I can't stand the idea of
						the suffering of the animal that dies, of life being broken to become
						a dish."
					   "Knowledge makes us free, allows us to understand who governs us, to understand what is
						good and what is bad. As Dario Fo says, the worker knows a hundred words and
						the industrialist knows a thousand, that's why the industrialist always tricks the worker. So
						I will always fight to support research, to support the study of astronomy
						and other fields."</p>
